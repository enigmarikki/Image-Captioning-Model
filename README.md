# Image-Captioning-Model

# Unique Features of the Model are:
<br> -> The model is capable on running on low-end GPUs such as the GTX 1050 with 4GB GPU Memory and 8GB RAM
<br> -> The learning of the model is Steep
<br> -> The Model was based on Images and captions scrapped from the E-Commerce Websites

<br>The Picture above summarises the RNN model that was used.</br>
<br>The Features of each image was extracted through the VGG16 model with the last softmax layer popped out and connected to a RNN layer. <br>
